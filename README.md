# M3-LS Micromanipulator
This Arduino-based solution utilizes [M3-LS linear smart stages](http://www.newscaletech.com/micro-mechatronics/m3-linear-stages.php) to provide cell biology researchers with an accessible method for nanoscale interaction with living cells. 

## Installation
An M3LS folder is provided that contains the Arduino library and examples folder. To install for use with the Arduino IDE, clone the repository and provide a link to the `M3LS` folder in `Arduino/libraries`.
